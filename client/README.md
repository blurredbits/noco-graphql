## NoCo Javascript GraphQL React Client

This is the React client for the NoCo Javascript GraphQL demo.

Before starting - just a couple of notes:

* Make sure the Server is running in another console window.

* Double check that the Port number is the same as defined in the Server. (Default is port: 4000). If this was changed on the Server side, please update the client to reflect the new port number.

* If starting with a blank DB, please add a few Breweries on the Server side with the `addBrewery` mutation and [GraphiQL](http://localhost:4000/graphql)

* Start the application with `yarn start`.

Cheers!
